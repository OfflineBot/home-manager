This is my home-manager setup for NixOS. 
The modules for my setup are spreaded into repos on my github.

Neovim: `https://gihtub.com/OfflineBot/neovim.git` <br>
Hyprland: `https://gihtub.com/OfflineBot/hyprland.git` <br>
Aylurs GTK Shell: `https://github.com/OfflineBot/ags.git` <br>

Neovim is probably soon be changed to Nixvim, the rest will probably stay (until i have a better option or i just put the config into a <app>.nix)
